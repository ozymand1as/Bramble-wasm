# Bramble RP2040/RP2350 Emulator - Changelog

## [0.39.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added - Complete RP2350 Hazard3 Emulation (All 3 Tiers)

- **Hazard3 custom CSRs**: meie0/meie1 (external IRQ enable), meip0/meip1 (external IRQ pending, read-only), mlei (lowest enabled pending IRQ), meiea/meipa/meifa/meicontext (IRQ array access). CSR writes update CLINT ext_enable in real-time.
- **Hardware stack protection**: mstack_base/mstack_limit CSRs for SP bounds checking (Hazard3 extension).
- **RP2350 peripheral module** (`rp2350_periph.c`): Unified implementation of 9 new RP2350 peripherals:
  - TICKS (0x40108000): 9 tick generators (proc0/1, timer0/1, watchdog, RISC-V, ref, ADC) with CTRL + CYCLES registers.
  - POWMAN (0x40100000): Power manager with VREG/BOD control, AON timer, power domain state.
  - QMI (0x400D0000): QSPI Memory Interface with direct-mode CSR, M0/M1 timing/format/command, address translation.
  - OTP (0x40120000/0x40130000): 8192-row OTP memory with controller registers and data readout (16-bit per row).
  - BOOTRAM (0x400E0000): 256-byte boot scratch RAM with byte/word access.
  - TIMER1 (0x400B8000): Second hardware timer (same register layout as RP2040 timer, with alarm checking).
  - TIMER0 (0x400B0000): RP2350 timer address redirect to RP2040 timer at 0x40054000.
  - GLITCH (0x40158000): Glitch detector register storage.
  - CORESIGHT (0x40140000): CoreSight trace register storage.
  - ACCESSCTRL (0x40160000): Peripheral access control (default all-access).
- **PIO2**: Third PIO block at 0x50400000 — `PIO_NUM_BLOCKS` increased to 3, `pio_match()` updated.
- **48-pin GPIO**: `NUM_GPIO_PINS` expanded from 30 to 48, interrupt register arrays expanded to 6 (from 4).
- **RP2350 SIO**: CPUID returns RP2350 identifier, GPIO_HI registers for pins 32-47 (out/oe/in), hart 1 launch mailbox.
- **Hart 1 launch protocol**: SIO mailbox at 0xD00001C0 — hart 0 writes entry/SP/arg, then triggers launch. Main loop detects pending launch and resets hart 1 with specified registers.
- **RISC-V instruction cache**: 64K-entry direct-mapped cache for flash/ROM instruction fetches. Avoids repeated memory bus reads. Reports hit/miss stats on exit.
- **RISC-V semihosting**: EBREAK with a0=0x20026 triggers SYS_EXIT (emulator shutdown).

## [0.38.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added - RP2350 RISC-V Full Integration (CLINT, Memory Bus, Bootrom, Firmware Auto-Detect)

- **RISC-V CLINT interrupt controller** (`src/rp2350_rv/rv_clint.c`): Machine timer (mtime/mtimecmp, 64-bit), software interrupts (MSIP per hart), external interrupt aggregation. Memory-mapped at 0xD0000100 in SIO space. Supports vectored and direct mtvec modes.
- **RP2350 memory bus** (`src/rp2350_rv/rv_membus.c`): 520KB SRAM (0x20000000-0x20082000) with alias support, 32KB ROM, flash access, CLINT routing. Falls through to shared RP2040 peripheral bus for UART/SPI/I2C/GPIO/etc.
- **RP2350 RISC-V bootrom** (`src/rp2350_rv/rv_bootrom.c`): Generated RISC-V code in 32KB ROM — sets SP to top of SRAM (0x20082000), sets GP to SRAM base, jumps to flash entry (0x10000000). Trap handler at 0x0004 loops on unhandled traps.
- **Dual-hart execution**: Cooperative step loop for both harts. Hart 1 halted until firmware launches. WFI support with interrupt wake.
- **CLINT mtime ticking**: Converts CPU cycles to microseconds via configurable cycles_per_us, matching `-clock` setting.
- **CLINT interrupt delivery**: Checks mip/mie/mstatus.MIE each step. Priority: MEIP > MSIP > MTIP. WFI wake on any pending+enabled interrupt.
- **UF2 family ID detection**: Reads UF2 flags bit 13 (family present) and identifies RP2040 (0xE48BFF56), RP2350-ARM (0xE48BFF59), RP2350-RV (0xE48BFF5A).
- **ELF RISC-V support**: Accepts EM_RISCV (243) ELF32 binaries in addition to EM_ARM (40).
- **Firmware auto-detection**: When `-arch` not specified, auto-detects architecture from UF2 family ID or ELF machine type and switches execution mode automatically.
- **RV CPU memory routing**: All memory accesses in `rv_cpu_step()` now route through RP2350 memory bus (520KB SRAM, ROM, CLINT) instead of RP2040 global membus.
- **Banner after load**: Architecture banner displayed after firmware loading and auto-detection, so it always reflects the correct mode.

### Files Added

- **`-arch` flag**: Runtime ISA selection — `-arch m0+` (default, RP2040 ARM) or `-arch rv32` (RP2350 Hazard3 RISC-V). Banner and execution loop adapt to selected architecture.
- **RP2350 memory map**: 520KB SRAM, up to 16MB flash, new peripheral addresses defined in `rp2350_memmap.h`.
- **RP2350 peripheral stubs**: TRNG (xorshift random), SHA-256, OTP (blank), HSTX, TICKS — wired into membus for read/write access.

---

## [0.36.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added - TAP Auto-Configuration, FAT Auto-Scan, and Warning-Free Build

- **TAP full host-side configuration**: `tapif_open()` now automatically assigns 192.168.4.1/24 to the TAP interface, brings it UP, enables IP forwarding, and sets up NAT masquerade via iptables/nft. On close, NAT rules are removed and forwarding is restored. No manual `ip addr add` needed.
- **FAT partition auto-scan**: `-mount` without `-mount-offset` now scans the entire `cpu.flash[]` (UF2 firmware + persisted data) for a valid FAT BPB (0x55AA signature + valid geometry). Automatically finds CircuitPython's FAT12 at 0x181000 or any other offset.
- **`-mount` works without `-flash`**: Volatile mount from UF2-loaded flash data (changes lost on exit). With `-flash`, changes persist across runs.

### Fixed

- **Flash initialized to 0xFF**: `cpu.flash[]` now starts erased (all 0xFF) matching real RP2040 hardware, fixing flash persistence sector detection.
- **FAT12 filesystem support**: FAT driver handles FAT12 (12-bit packed entries, EOC 0xFF8) in addition to FAT16.
- **FUSE flash mutex race**: ROM flash writes now lock `fuse_flash_mutex`.
- **TAP persistent read errors**: `cyw43_tap_poll()` closes TAP fd on error instead of spin-polling.
- **CYW43 PIO buffer overflow**: `pio_resp_buf` copy length clamped to buffer size.
- **All compiler warnings resolved**: Fixed unused variables (`addr` in thumb32, `raw_best_ms` in benchmark), unused parameters (`ifname` in setup_nat), uninitialized variables (`off` in devtools), `strncpy` truncation (replaced with `memcpy`+`memset`), suppressed GCC 15 false-positive `stringop-overflow` from system headers.

### Changed

- **`build.sh` rewritten**: Auto-detects FUSE, supports `--clean`/`--no-fuse`/`--release`/`--debug`/`--help`. No longer destructive (no `git pull` or `rm -rf`).
- **CMakeLists.txt updated**: Version 0.36.0, FUSE definitions applied to all targets, deduplicated source lists, build summary output.

### Tests

- 276 tests passing, zero compiler warnings.

---

## [0.35.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added - Advanced Developer Tools

- **ELF symbol loading** (`-symbols <elf>`): Parses .symtab/.strtab from ELF32 files for function name resolution in hotspots, profiles, callgraphs, crash reports, and memory watch logs.
- **Call graph** (`-callgraph <file>`): Tracks BL/BLX calls to build caller→callee graph with call counts. DOT format output for Graphviz visualization.
- **Stack watermark** (`-stack-check`): Per-core SP high-water mark tracking. Reports peak stack depth on exit with warnings if SP approaches RAM base.
- **IRQ latency profiling** (`-irq-latency`): Measures cycles from `nvic_signal_irq()` to exception handler entry. Reports min/avg/max per IRQ number.
- **Bus transaction logging** (`-log-uart`, `-log-spi`, `-log-i2c`): Logs every byte TX/RX with hex and printable representation to stderr.
- **GPIO VCD trace** (`-gpio-trace <file>`): Records all GPIO pin changes with cycle-accurate timestamps in Value Change Dump format for GTKWave/PulseView.
- **Scripted I/O** (`-script <file>`): Timestamped UART/GPIO input injection from text files (`100ms: uart0 "hello\n"`, `200ms: gpio25 1`).
- **Expected output matching** (`-expect <file>`): Captures stdout (UART + USB CDC) and compares against golden file on exit. Exit 0 on match, 1 on diff with byte-level diff location.
- **Memory watch log** (`-watch <addr[:len]>`): Logs every read/write to an address range to stderr with PC and symbol context. Up to 8 simultaneous regions.
- **Fault injection** (`-inject-fault <spec>`): Schedule hardware faults at cycle counts: `flash_bitflip:cycle:addr`, `ram_corrupt:cycle:addr`, `brownout:cycle`.
- **Cycle profiling** (`-profile <file>`): Per-PC cycle accounting with CSV output. Combined with `-symbols`, gives per-function timing breakdown.
- **Memory heatmap** (`-mem-heatmap <file>`): Tracks read/write frequency per 256-byte RAM block. CSV output for visualization.

### Files Modified

- `include/devtools.h` + `src/devtools.c` — All new tools and symbol table loader
- `src/thumb32.c` — Callgraph recording on BL instructions
- `src/nvic.c` — IRQ latency pend timestamp recording
- `src/uart.c` — UART TX bus logging and expect capture hooks
- `src/usb.c` — USB CDC expect capture hook
- `src/gpio.c` — GPIO VCD trace on SIO output writes
- `src/membus.c` — Memory watch and heatmap hooks on RAM read/write fast paths
- `src/cpu.c` — Profile, stack check, IRQ cycle counter in cpu_step hot path

### Tests

- 276 tests passing. No performance regression (all tools gated behind `__builtin_expect(flag, 0)`).

---

## [0.34.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added - Developer Tools, Missing Peripherals, and Performance Audit

- **SYSCFG peripheral** (0x40004000): NMI mask, proc config, debug force, memory power-down registers. Fully wired with atomic aliases.
- **TBMAN peripheral** (0x4006C000): Testbench Manager returns PLATFORM=ASIC (0x01) matching real RP2040 hardware.
- **ARM semihosting** (`-semihosting`): Intercepts BKPT #0xAB for SYS_WRITEC/WRITE0/WRITE/READC/EXIT/EXIT_EXTENDED. Enables test frameworks (Unity, CppUTest) and newlib rdimon specs.
- **Code coverage** (`-coverage <file>`): Bitmap tracking executed 16-bit-aligned PCs across flash and RAM. Dumps binary file with header on exit; reports summary statistics.
- **Hotspot profiling** (`-hotspots [N]`): 256K-entry hash map counting per-PC execution frequency. Reports top-N addresses by region (flash/rom/ram) on exit.
- **Instruction trace** (`-trace <file>`): Streams (PC, opcode, cycles) tuples as 8-byte binary records for offline analysis. Binary format with header.
- **Exit code hook** (`-exit-code <addr>`): Reads uint32 from a RAM address on halt and uses it as the process exit code. Enables CI test result reporting.
- **Timeout enforcement** (`-timeout <seconds>`): Wall-clock limit via SIGALRM. Returns exit code 124 (GNU timeout convention) when exceeded.

### Fixed

- **JIT timing undercount**: `timing_lut[]` returns 0 for dynamic-cost instructions (PUSH/POP/LDMIA/STMIA). Non-terminal JIT instructions were accumulating 0 cycles, starving SysTick and hanging littleOS benchmarks. Fix: fall back to `timing_instruction_cycles()` when LUT returns 0.
- **JIT invalidation O(16K) per RAM write**: `jit_invalidate_addr()` had an inverted early-return — it scanned all 16,384 blocks for every STR to RAM despite JIT only compiling flash/ROM code. This caused `memcpy` to hang. Fix: early-return for RAM addresses.
- **JIT CBZ/CBNZ not terminal**: CBZ (0xB1/0xB3) and CBNZ (0xB9/0xBB) were missing from the JIT terminal set, allowing blocks to execute past conditional branches.
- **JIT compile bounds check**: Used `&&` instead of `||` for ROM/flash range validation during block compilation.

### Performance

- JIT block max: 32→64 instructions; removed `__attribute__((packed))` from block struct.
- JIT terminal check: bitmap lookup replaces 9 sequential if-else branches.
- membus: RAM read/write promoted to first check (before flash/XIP). GDB watchpoint calls gated with `__builtin_expect(gdb.active, 0)`.
- Synthetic benchmark: 182→161 MIPS (JIT, regression from 64-insn blocks but real workloads benefit).
- littleOS JIT: was HUNG, now completes in 3447ms (matches no-JIT exactly).

### Files Added

- `include/devtools.h` + `src/devtools.c` — Developer tools (semihosting, coverage, hotspots, trace, SYSCFG, TBMAN)

### Tests

- 276 tests passing.

---

## [0.33.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added - Privilege Escalation, Watchdog Hardening, and Dual-Core Correctness

- Automatic privilege escalation: `-tap` and `-mount` flags now detect when root is needed, explain why, and re-exec via `sudo` with `BRAMBLE_ESCALATED` env guard to prevent loops. Falls back with a manual command hint on failure.
- Help text annotates privileged flags with `(sudo)` so users know before running.
- Watchdog reboot now fully resets multicore state: `num_active_cores` reset to 1, Core 1 bootrom launch state machine cleared, spinlocks and shared RAM zeroed, `active_core` reset to CORE0. Firmware must re-launch Core 1 through the standard FIFO protocol after reboot.
- `nvic_init()` now calls `systick_reset()` so both cores' SysTick counters are properly cleared on watchdog reboot and peripheral re-initialization.
- `dual_core_init()` resets the Core 1 bootrom state machine (`waiting_for_launch`, `launch_count`) preventing stale launch state from surviving across reboots.

### Fixed

- Watchdog reboot left `num_active_cores = 2` from Core 1 auto-launch, causing the emulator to step a halted Core 1 after reboot instead of letting firmware re-launch it.
- Watchdog reboot did not clear spinlocks, shared RAM, or the Core 1 bootrom handshake state, potentially causing firmware to see stale inter-core state.
- SysTick state survived watchdog reboot because `systick_reset()` was never called from `nvic_init()` or the peripheral reset path.
- Test `test_num_active_cores_default` was invalidated by `setup()` setting `num_active_cores = MAX_CORES` before the test ran.

### Tests

- 276 tests passing (was 274), including watchdog multicore reset correctness and updated core pool assertions.

---

## [Unreleased - pre-0.33.0] - 2026-03-20

### Changed - Maintenance, Hardening, and Documentation Consolidation

- Hardened the UF2 loader against oversized payloads and overflowed flash writes.
- Hardened ELF `PT_LOAD` handling with overflow-safe bounds checks and `p_filesz <= p_memsz` validation.
- Watchdog and `SYSRESETREQ` reboot paths now reinitialize the full runtime peripheral set instead of a partial reset.
- Core pool registry updates now hold a single lock window for read/modify/write operations.
- Wire transport now handles partial `SOCK_STREAM` reads and writes safely without desynchronizing frames.
- `-stdin` now stages host input until a guest console is ready, preserving littleOS interactive shells while still delivering early piped or interactive input to USB CDC firmware such as MicroPython.
- Consolidated the old `UPDATES.md` history into this file and refreshed `README.md`, `Bramble_Guide.md`, and `docs/`.
- Added end-to-end regression coverage for memory-mapped alias paths including flash XIP aliases, NVIC subword MMIO, XIP SSI, IO_QSPI, PADS_QSPI, and BUSCTRL.
- Added exception-path regression coverage for SVCall entry/return, IRQ delivery through `cpu_step()`, nested exception unwind, invalid-PC HardFault entry, and double-HardFault lockup.
- Fixed the remaining `PADS_QSPI` decode overlap so QSPI pad accesses no longer fall through the generic `PADS_BANK0` path.
- Tightened the CPU hot path with direct ROM/flash/RAM halfword fetches and earlier JIT block dispatch, and added a tunable `-thread-quantum` for host-threaded execution.

### Tests

- 274 tests passing, including loader hardening, watchdog reset, core pool, wire transport, USB CDC RX readiness, stdin-routing regressions, memory-map alias coverage, and exception-path coverage

## [0.28.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added - Host-Threaded Execution & Dynamic Core Allocation

**pthread-per-core Execution Model:**

- Each emulated RP2040 core runs in its own host pthread for true parallelism
- Big lock (mutex) synchronizes shared peripheral state between core threads
- WFI/WFE instructions put host threads to sleep (condition variable, zero CPU usage)
- Interrupt delivery (NVIC pend, SysTick, PendSV) wakes sleeping threads via condvar signal
- SEV instruction wakes all sleeping cores
- Cooperative round-robin still available as fallback (default when no `-cores` flag)

**Runtime Core Configuration:**

- `-cores N` flag: 1 for single-core, 2 for dual-core (default: 2)
- `-cores auto`: queries core pool for optimal allocation based on host CPUs and running instances
- Threaded mode automatically enabled when `-cores` is specified

**Multi-Instance Core Pool:**

- File-based registry (`/tmp/bramble-corepool.reg`) tracks running bramble instances
- Each instance registers its PID and allocated core count

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed - Clean Output Separation + Robustness

**Stdout/Stderr Separation**:

- All emulator boot, init, loader, and status messages redirected to stderr
- Firmware UART/USB CDC output is now the only thing on stdout
- Enables clean piping: `./bramble firmware.uf2 -stdin > output.txt`
- Affected files: main.c, cpu.c, rom.c, uf2.c, elf.c, gdb.c

**Runtime Diagnostic Printf Gated Behind `-debug`**:

- Timer alarm/disarm/interrupt messages gated behind `cpu.debug_enabled`
- FIFO push/pop warnings gated behind `cpu.debug_enabled`
- IT instruction, UDF, BKPT, unimplemented instruction messages gated
- Eliminates all spurious stdout output during normal firmware execution

**BKPT and Unhandled 32-bit Instructions Now HardFault**:

- BKPT previously halted emulator (set PC=0xFFFFFFFF); now triggers HardFault exception
- Unhandled 32-bit Thumb instructions previously halted; now trigger HardFault
- Allows firmware HardFault handlers to catch these instead of crashing emulator

**Interactive Mode Instruction Limit**:

- 1B instruction safety limit now disabled when `-stdin` flag is active
- Enables long-running firmware (MicroPython REPL, interactive shells) to run indefinitely
- GDB mode already had this behavior; stdin mode now matches

### Files Modified

- `src/instructions.c` - BKPT→HardFault, gated printf for IT/UDF/BKPT/unimplemented
- `src/cpu.c` - Gated FIFO warnings, EXC_RETURN error, PC-out-of-bounds; boot messages→stderr
- `src/timer.c` - Gated all alarm/interrupt diagnostic printf
- `src/main.c` - All printf→fprintf(stderr), stdin disables instruction limit
- `src/rom.c`, `src/uf2.c`, `src/elf.c`, `src/gdb.c` - printf→fprintf(stderr)
- `tests/test_suite.c` - 237 tests (unchanged)

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added - USB Device Enumeration + Flash Persistence

**USB Host Enumeration Simulation**:

- Full USB host state machine simulating device enumeration:
  - Bus reset → GET_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR (8 bytes) → SET_ADDRESS
  - GET_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR (full) → GET_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR (short + full)
  - SET_CONFIGURATION → CDC SET_LINE_CODING → SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE (DTR+RTS)
- SIE_STATUS properly reflects VBUS_DETECTED, CONNECTED, BUS_RESET, SETUP_REC, TRANS_COMPLETE
- BUFF_STATUS tracking with W1C semantics, INTR/INTS dynamic computation
- Control transfer phase tracking (setup → data in/out → status in/out → done)
- Enumeration waits for PULLUP_EN (SIE_CTRL bit 16) before starting
- Paced by firmware EP0 buffer responses (polls buffer control for AVAILABLE/FULL)

**USB CDC Data Bridge**:

- Configuration descriptor parsing to find CDC bulk endpoints (class 0x0A, endpoint type 2)
- CDC bulk IN: firmware data printed to stdout
- CDC bulk OUT: `usb_cdc_rx_push()` injects stdin bytes into device
- `usb_step()` called from main loop advances enumeration and CDC transfer
- `stdio_usb_connected()` returns true after full enumeration

**Flash Persistence** (`-flash <path>`):

- On startup: loads flash file, restores non-firmware sectors (preserves UF2 firmware, restores filesystem)
- On exit: saves full 2MB flash image to file
- Smart sector detection: 4KB sectors compared against 0xFF to identify firmware vs filesystem
- Enables littlefs/FAT filesystem persistence across emulator runs

### Files Modified

- `include/usb.h` - Complete rewrite: enumeration enums, CDC fields, expanded state struct
- `src/usb.c` - Complete rewrite (~400 lines): enumeration engine, CDC bridge, control transfers

**GPIO Edge/Level Interrupt Detection**:

- Automatic INTR bit setting when pin values change via SIO writes or `gpio_set_input_pin()`
- Level interrupts: continuously recomputed from current pin state (not latched)
- Edge interrupts: latched on rising/falling transitions, cleared by W1C
- Triggers NVIC IRQ 13 (IO_IRQ_BANK0) through INTE/INTF/INTS chain
- `gpio_set_input_pin()` API for external input changes with event detection

**PIO INTR from FIFO Status**:

- INTR register dynamically computed from hardware state:
  - Bits [11:8]: SM IRQ flags
  - Bits [7:4]: TX FIFO not full (per SM)
  - Bits [3:0]: RX FIFO not empty (per SM)
- INTS = (INTR | INTF) & INTE for both IRQ0 and IRQ1
- IRQ check after each `pio_step()` cycle and after `pio_write32()`

**Dynamic Frequency Reporting**:

- FC0_RESULT computed from PLL_SYS registers: `(12MHz * FBDIV) / (REFDIV * POSTDIV1 * POSTDIV2)`
- `machine.freq()` returns actual configured frequency instead of hardcoded 125MHz
- Defaults to 125MHz when PLL not yet configured

### Files Modified

**RTC Stub** (0x4005C000):

- Register-level: CLKDIV_M1, SETUP_0/1, CTRL, IRQ registers

- 14 function table entries including 6 flash function no-op stubs
- CPU execution from ROM addresses (0x00000000-0x00000FFF)

**USB Controller Stub**:

- DPRAM (0x50100000) and REGS (0x50110000) accept reads/writes
- Returns 0 (disconnected); SDK `stdio_usb_init()` times out and falls back to UART

**UART Module** (extracted from membus.c):

- Dual PL011 UARTs (UART0 + UART1) with independent state
- 12 registers with read-back: DR, RSR, IBRD, FBRD, LCR_H, CR, IFLS, IMSC, RIS, MIS, ICR, DMACR

- High-register CMP (0x4500-0x45FF) uses 4-bit register fields
- Split into `instr_cmp_alu()` and `instr_cmp_reg_reg()` for correct decoding

### Testing

- **31 new tests** (145 total, up from 114)
- 7 new categories: ROM Function Table, USB Controller Stub, Flash ROM Functions, UART Peripheral, SPI Peripheral, I2C Peripheral, PWM Peripheral

### Files Added

- Left-shifting negative `int8_t` is undefined behavior in C99
- Fixed: `((int32_t)offset) * 2` replaces `(int32_t)(offset << 24) >> 23`

**Timer auto-INTE** (`timer.c`):

- Writing ALARM registers incorrectly auto-enabled interrupt enable bits
- RP2040 only auto-arms alarms on write; INTE is set separately by firmware
- Removed `timer_state.inte |= ...` from all 4 alarm write handlers

**SYST_CALIB TENMS** (`nvic.c`):

- Changed from 0xC0000000 (TENMS=0) to 0xC0002710 (TENMS=10000)
- 10000 µs = 10 ms, matching emulator's 1 cycle = 1 µs timing model

**Timer 64-bit atomic read** (`timer.c`):

- Added latch mechanism: reading TIMELR latches TIMEHR for consistent 64-bit reads
- Matches RP2040 hardware behavior

### Testing

- 10 clock generators (GPOUT0-3, REF, SYS, PERI, USB, ADC, RTC)
- Each with CTRL, DIV, SELECTED registers at stride 0x0C
- SELECTED always returns non-zero (clock source stable)
- FC0_STATUS returns DONE=1, FC0_RESULT returns 125MHz

**XOSC (0x40024000)**:

- STATUS returns STABLE (bit 31) + ENABLED (bit 12)
- CTRL and STARTUP registers writable

**PLLs (0x40028000 / 0x4002C000)**:

- PLL_SYS and PLL_USB: CS.LOCK=1 (bit 31) always set
- PWR, FBDIV, PRIM registers writable
- Shared implementation for both PLLs

**Watchdog (0x40058000)**:

- CTRL, LOAD, REASON (always 0 = clean boot), TICK registers

- TICK returns RUNNING=1 when ENABLE bit set

**ADC (0x4004C000)**:

- 5 channels (4 GPIO + temperature sensor channel 4)
- CS (with READY always set), RESULT, FIFO, DIV, interrupt registers
- Temperature sensor defaults to ~27C (0x036C)
- `adc_set_channel_value()` for test injection
- START_ONCE auto-clears (conversion completes instantly)

**UART0 Register Expansion**:

- Full register set: DR, FR, IBRD, FBRD, LCR_H, CR, IMSC, RIS, MIS, ICR
- Replaces previous minimal DR/FR handling

**RP2040 Atomic Register Aliases**:

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added - Phase 1: Core Correctness

**SysTick Timer**:

- Full SysTick implementation with SYST_CSR/RVR/CVR/CALIB registers
- Counter decrements every CPU step, reloads from RVR on wrap
- COUNTFLAG and TICKINT generate SysTick exceptions through priority-based NVIC delivery

**32-bit Instruction Dispatch**:

- MSR (0xF380 8800): write APSR flags, MSP, PRIMASK, CONTROL
- MRS (0xF3EF 8xxx): read APSR, IPSR, EPSR, xPSR, MSP, PRIMASK, CONTROL
- DSB/DMB/ISB (0xF3BF 8Fxx): memory barrier NOPs (correct for emulator)

**NVIC Priority Preemption**:

- `nvic_get_exception_priority()` for any exception vector number
- Pending IRQs only delivered when priority < active exception's priority
- SCB_SHPR2/SHPR3 for SVCall, PendSV, SysTick priority configuration
- PendSV set/clear via SCB_ICSR writes

**CONTROL Register**:

- Added to both `cpu_state_t` and `cpu_state_dual_t`
- Read/write via MSR/MRS, preserved across dual-core context switches

**SCB Registers**:

- No DMA, USB, or PIO emulation
- Timer uses simplified 1 cycle = 1 microsecond model

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added - Performance, Correctness & Features

**Performance**:

- **Zero-copy dual-core context switching**: Eliminated 132KB RAM memcpy per step; memory bus pointer redirection via `mem_set_ram_ptr()` swaps only 64 bytes of registers
- **Shared flash storage**: Removed duplicate 2MB flash from `cpu_state_dual_t`; both cores read from single `cpu.flash` array (~4MB saved)
- **O(1) instruction dispatch table**: 256-entry lookup table indexed by `instr >> 8` replaces ~60-branch if-else chain; secondary dispatchers for ALU/misc blocks

**Correctness**:

- **PRIMASK register**: `CPSID`/`CPSIE` now set/clear `cpu.primask`; interrupt delivery gated by PRIMASK check in `cpu_step()`
- **SVC exception**: `instr_svc()` triggers SVCall (vector 11) via `cpu_exception_entry()` with correct stacked return address
- **RAM execution**: `cpu_is_halted()` and `cpu_step()` now accept PC in RAM range (0x20000000-0x20042000)

**Features**:

- **Peripheral stubs**: SPI0/SPI1 (PL022 status), I2C0/I2C1, PWM return sensible idle values; writes accepted silently
- **ELF loader**: `load_elf()` loads ELF32 ARM LE binaries with PT_LOAD segment handling for flash and RAM; auto-detected by `.elf` extension
- **New instructions**: ADCS (add with carry), SBCS (subtract with carry), RSBS (negate)

**Testing**:

- **Unit test suite**: 36 tests across 10 categories (PRIMASK, SVC, RAM execution, dispatch table, peripheral stubs, ADCS/SBCS/RSBS, dual-core memory, ELF loader, memory bus, instruction integration)
- Built as `bramble_tests` CMake target, integrated with CTest

### Files Added

- `src/elf.c` - ELF32 ARM binary loader
- `tests/test_suite.c` - Unit test suite (36 tests)

### Files Modified

- `src/cpu.c` - Dispatch table, zero-copy dual-core, PRIMASK-aware interrupt delivery, RAM execution
- `src/instructions.c` - PRIMASK, SVC exception, ADCS/SBCS/RSBS, `pc_updated` flag pattern
- `src/membus.c` - Pointer-based RAM routing, SPI/I2C/PWM stubs, shared flash reads
- `include/emulator.h` - PRIMASK fields, peripheral base addresses, `mem_set_ram_ptr()`, ELF loader declaration
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Added `elf.c` source, `bramble_tests` target

### Known Issues

- Shared RAM (0x20040000) partially overlaps Core 1's per-core RAM range
- No DMA, USB, or PIO emulation
- Timer uses simplified 1 cycle = 1 microsecond model

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed - Audit-Driven Correctness and Performance Bugs

- Preserved the xPSR Thumb bit when updating flags.
- Fixed register-offset `LDR`/`STR`, `ADDS Rd,Rn,Rm` flag handling, `POP` exception return, `ASR #0`, `REV16`, and register `ROR`.
- Removed Core 1 re-entry resets, FIFO deadlocks, inverted spinlock acquisition, and dual-core peripheral-routing gaps.
- Fixed instruction counting for halted cores, `WFI` double-PC advance, `SCB_VTOR` readback, and unsafe UF2 alignment-dependent pointer casts.
- Reduced dual-core per-step copying overhead and removed unconditional timer hot-path printf noise.

### Files Modified

- `src/instructions.c` - ALU, shift, exception return, and decode fixes
- `src/cpu.c` - Core stepping, FIFO/spinlock behavior, and performance cleanup
- `src/membus.c` - Dual-core peripheral routing and timer printf cleanup
- `src/uf2.c` - Safe unaligned field reads
- `src/nvic.c`, `src/main.c`, `src/timer.c` - Correctness and diagnostics fixes

---

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-30

### Added - Unified Main & Dual-Core Production

**Major Features**:
- **Unified main.c**: Single source file supporting both single-core and dual-core modes
  - Auto-detection via `#ifdef DUAL_CORE_ENABLED`
  - Conditional compilation for cleaner codebase
  - Unified argument parsing for all platforms
  
**Dual-Core Release**:
- Full dual-core CPU emulation support
- Independent Core 0 and Core 1 execution
- Shared flash (2 MB), separate RAM (128 KB each), shared RAM (64 KB)
- Dual FIFO channels for inter-core communication
- 32-entry spinlock array for synchronization
- SIO atomic operations support

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.c` - Completely rewritten as unified main supporting both modes
- `include/emulator.h` - Configuration for single/dual-core selection
- `include/emulator_dual.h` - Dual-core specific definitions
- `src/cpu_dual.c` - Dual-core CPU implementation
- `src/multicore.c` - Inter-core communication and FIFO/spinlock support
- `README.md` - Updated with dual-core documentation and examples
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Unified build configuration

### Changed

- **Unified Architecture**: Replaced separate main.c and main_dual.c with single unified version
  - Single-core build: 8KB less binary size (no dual-core code)
  - Dual-core build: Full dual-core support with shared codebase
  - Cleaner maintenance: Features added once apply to both modes

- **Memory Layout Standardization**: Consistent vector table handling across modes
  - Single-core: Reads vector table from FLASH_BASE + 0x100
  - Dual-core: Uses dual_core_init() which handles internally
  - Both: Correct offset (0x100) for code after boot2

- **Debug Modes Unified**:
  - Single-core: `-debug`, `-asm`, combined modes
  - Dual-core: `-debug` (Core 0), `-debug1` (Core 1), `-status`, combinations
  - All modes share argument parsing logic

- **Build Configuration**:
  - Single CMakeLists.txt for both modes
  - No commented-out files
  - Clean dependency tracking

### Fixed

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
1. **Two main.c files conflict**: Unified into single main.c
2. **Vector table address confusion**: Standardized offset (FLASH_BASE + 0x100)
3. **Inconsistent initialization**: Both paths now use same boot logic
4. **CMakeLists ambiguity**: Single configuration file, mode selected via emulator.h

### Documentation

- **README.md**:
  - Added "Production Ready" status
  - Dual-core section with features and examples
  - Memory layout for dual-core configuration
  - Hardware mode selection instructions
  - Updated project structure with dual-core files
  
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This file
  - Clear migration path from previous versions
  - Build instructions for single and dual-core
  - Testing procedures

### Testing Confirmed

**Single-Core Mode**:
```bash
# Comment out: #define DUAL_CORE_ENABLED in emulator.h
./bramble hello_world.uf2
# Output: Single-core banner and execution ✅
```

**Dual-Core Mode**:
```bash
# Uncomment: #define DUAL_CORE_ENABLED in emulator.h
./bramble littleOS.uf2 -debug -status
# Output: Dual-core banner, both cores execute ✅
```

### Migration Guide (for users upgrading from 0.2.1)

1. **Replace main files**:
   ```bash
   cp main_unified.c src/main.c
   rm src/main_dual.c  # No longer needed
   ```

2. **Update CMakeLists.txt**: Ensure `src/main.c` is NOT commented out

3. **Select hardware mode** in `include/emulator.h`:
   ```c
   #define DUAL_CORE_ENABLED  // or comment out for single-core
   ```

4. **Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   make clean && make -j4
   ```

5. **Test**:
   ```bash
   ./bramble firmware.uf2  # Single or dual depending on config
   ```

### Performance Impact

- **Single-Core**: No change in execution speed or memory usage
- **Dual-Core**: ~1.8-2.0x total instruction throughput (both cores step together)
- **Startup**: Minimal overhead (< 1ms for initialization)
- **Memory**: Shared codebase saves ~8KB in single-core binary

### Known Issues

- NVIC still missing 3 features (see [0.2.1] notes)
- Dual-core testing framework in progress
- Performance optimization pending for high-frequency scenarios

### Contributors

Special thanks to Night-Traders-Dev team for dual-core architecture guidance and testing.

- `include/gpio.h` - GPIO register definitions and API
- `test-firmware/gpio_test.S` - Assembly test firmware for GPIO
- `docs/GPIO.md` - Comprehensive GPIO documentation

#### Features Implemented

**SIO GPIO Registers (Fast Access)**:
- `SIO_GPIO_IN` (0xD0000004) - Read current pin states
- `SIO_GPIO_OUT` (0xD0000010) - GPIO output values
- `SIO_GPIO_OUT_SET/CLR/XOR` - Atomic bit manipulation
- `SIO_GPIO_OE` and atomic variants - Output enable control

**IO_BANK0 Registers**:
- Per-pin STATUS and CTRL registers for all 30 pins
- Function select support (SIO, UART, SPI, I2C, PWM, PIO, etc.)
- GPIO interrupt configuration registers (INTR, INTE, INTF, INTS)

**PADS_BANK0 Registers**:
- Pad control for all 30 GPIO pins
- Pull-up/pull-down configuration
- Drive strength and slew rate settings

**Helper Functions**:
```c
void gpio_init(void);                      // Initialize GPIO subsystem
void gpio_reset(void);                     // Reset to power-on defaults
void gpio_set_pin(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value);    // Set pin high/low
uint8_t gpio_get_pin(uint8_t pin);                // Read pin state
void gpio_set_direction(uint8_t pin, uint8_t output);
void gpio_set_function(uint8_t pin, uint8_t func);
```

#### Integration
- GPIO registers routed through memory bus (`membus.c`)
- GPIO initialized at boot in `main.c`
- 8/16/32-bit memory access support
- Atomic operations properly implemented

#### Testing
- New `gpio_test.uf2` firmware demonstrating:
  - Pin configuration (GPIO 25 as output)
  - Output enable control
  - Atomic set/clear operations
  - Pin state readback
  - Toggle operations with delays

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive GPIO.md with:
  - Register map and descriptions
  - Function select table
  - Usage examples (assembly)
  - Integration details
  - Limitations and future work
- Updated README.md with GPIO features
- Updated build scripts to support GPIO test firmware

### Changed

- **membus.c**: Added GPIO register routing
- **main.c**: Added `gpio_init()` call at boot
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Added `gpio.c` to build
- **test-firmware/build.sh**: Enhanced to support multiple firmware targets
- **README.md**: Updated status from "Working Beta" to "Enhanced Beta"

### Technical Details

**GPIO State Structure**:
```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t gpio_in;        // Input values
    uint32_t gpio_out;       // Output values  
    uint32_t gpio_oe;        // Output enable
    
    struct {
        uint32_t status;     // Per-pin status
        uint32_t ctrl;       // Per-pin control
    } pins[30];
    
    uint32_t intr[4];        // Interrupt status
    uint32_t proc0_inte[4];  // Interrupt enable
    uint32_t proc0_intf[4];  // Interrupt force
    uint32_t proc0_ints[4];  // Interrupt status
    
    uint32_t pads[30];       // Pad configurations
} gpio_state_t;
```

**Memory Regions**:
- IO_BANK0: `0x40014000 - 0x400141FF` (512 bytes)
- PADS_BANK0: `0x4001C000 - 0x4001C0FF` (256 bytes)
- SIO GPIO: `0xD0000000 - 0xD00000FF` (256 bytes)

### Known Limitations

- GPIO interrupts register state but don't trigger CPU exceptions (requires NVIC)
- No electrical simulation (instant state changes)
- Processor 1 interrupt registers not implemented
- Input synchronization is instant (no delay)
